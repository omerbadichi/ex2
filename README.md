In our second assignment we were asked to classify a given vector based on the machine learning method: KNN.
## KNN:
This method classify a certain data(in our project represented by a vector), the method compare the distances between our data vector to its
already classified vectors, and return the most popular classification among the k(an integer) vectors with the smallest distance between ours.
